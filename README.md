# Sorting Visualizer Using Java

## Introduction

Sorting Visualizer is a Java-based project that uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to let people see different sorting algorithms in action. By graphically illustrating each sorting algorithm's step-by-step sorting process, it offers an engaging and instructive approach to learn how different sorting algorithms operate.
## Features and Characteristics
- Sorting Algorithms: The visualizer supports a variety of sorting algorithms.They are
  - Bubble Sort
  - Gnome Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quandrix Sort
  - Radix Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Shell Sort

- Real-Time Visualization: Users can observe the sorting algorithms in real-time, as the visualizer animates the sorting process step by step.

- Adjustable Speed: The visualizer allows users to control the speed of the sorting animation, enabling them to slow down or speed up the visualization as per their preference.
